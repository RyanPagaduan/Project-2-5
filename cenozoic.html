        <h2>Woolly Mammoth</h2>

        <p>Woolly mammoths are large elephantine creatures that lived during the most recent ice age during the Pleistocene Epoch, having went extinct about 10,000 years ago. However, some isolated populations of the species died out just around 4,000 years ago. The woolly mammoths are widely famous for their long, shaggy, fur, large tusks, and adaptations to their cold habitat. Their dense, insulating coat of long hair and an undercoat aided the woolly mammoths in surviving in the frigid environments of the Pleistocene Epoch. Their most distinctive feature was their long, curved tusks, with males' tusks being able to reach impressive lengths of up to 15 feet. They were likely used for various purposes which included digging for food, attracting mates, and as a defense mechanism. Besdies their fur, woolly mammoths had smaller ears along with shorter tails than modern day elephants, which helped in minimizing heat loss in cold temperatures. Having coexisted with with early humans, it often considered that climate change and human hunting may have caused their extinction. Woolly mammoths also play some cultural significance such as in their reprsentation in prehistoric art with numerous depictions found in cave paintings and other forms of early human art, and even appearing in the 3D animated Ice Age movies distriburted by 20th Century Studios.</p>
        
        <h2>Saber-Toothed Tiger (or Smilodon)</h2>

        <p>The saber-toothed tiger, sometimes referred to as the smilodon, is another famous creature that lived during the ice age, during the Eocene epoch around 56 million years ago until the end of the Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs, becoming extinct approximately 10,000 years ago. They are mostly renowned for their exceptionally long, saber-like canine teeth, which were able to grow up to 20 cm, 8 inches long. These sharp razor teeth were used for hunting large prey, likely by stabbing and slashing attacks. However, these teeth were surprisingly fragile and could break during hunting. The smilodon also had a skull modified to accomodate the strong neck muscles needed to drive the canine teeth into prey. Their jaw was able to open to a wide angle, allowing for the use of their large teeth. These creatures were powerfully built felines, particularly in their forelimbs, which were used to grapple with and hold down onto their prey. They sometimes stuck as ambush predators, relying on stealth and powerful initial attack rather than sustained chases. Some of the animals they preyed upon included bison, camels, and even young mammoths or mastodons. While not officially proven, some evidence suggests that the smilodon may have lived in social groups, similar to modern lions, and may have helped injured members from their group. Just like the woolly mammoths, they've also appeared in the Ice Age movies</p>

        <p>The daeodon, also known as "Dinohyus", was a large, pig-like mammal that lived in North America between 29 and 19 million years ago during the late and Oligocene and Early Miocene epochs but are thought to have gone extinct around 16 million years ago. They are known for their size, omnivorous diet, and distinctive bony head structures. They were also one of the largest entelodonts, a group of hoofed mammals. The daeodon is estimated to be around 1.77 meters, which is about 5.8 feet tall at the shoulders. It had a long, narrow head with prominent bony flanges on the sides of its cheeks. They are said to have had an omnivorous diet, feeding on both vegetation and meat. They are believed to have fed on plants such as roots, tubers, and fruits, and also hunted smaller animals. Some paleontological sites suggest that it posssessed powerful teeth capable of crushing bones and tearing flesh. Their habitats are widely considered to have been woodlands and grasslands. Fossils of this creature have been found in areas ranging from South Dakota to Florida. Some fossil evidence suggests the daeodon may have engaged in scavenging, potentially following predators to steal their kills or feeding on carrion.</p>

        <p>Being one of the most famous extinct shark species known to man, specifically for its massive size, the megalodon lived approximately 23 million to 3.6 million years ago. This period spans from the Early Miocene to the early Pliocene epochs, having dominated and terrorized the oceans for roughly 20 million years. It was estimated to be three times larger than the biggest modern great white sharks. The megalodon is said to have potentially reahced up to 60 feet. Its teeth, which are the most common fossils of the megalodon found, can reach up to 7 inches long. Other things that the megalodon is widely famous for other than being one of the biggest shark species documented was the fact that it was a top predator, meaining it occupied the highest trophic level in its ecosystem and was considered on top of the food chain during its existence. Fossil evidence, such as tooth marks on whale bones, indicates it hunted large marine mammals such as whales. The megalodon's bite force is esitamted to be the strongest of any known creature, possibly going up to 40,000 pounds per square inch. Their extinction may have been caused by certain things such as climate change, which may have affected their food supply and pupping grounds, and competition with other large predators like great white sharks. While their cartilaginous skeletons don't fossilize well, megalodon teeth are the most commonly found fossil evidnece of the megalodon's existence, providing valuable insights into their size, diet, and even their evolutionary relationships with other sharks. The megalodon has remained a popular creature in popular culture such as in documentaries and in films such as the 2018 film The Meg and its sequel, The Meg 2: The Trench which released in 2023.</p>
