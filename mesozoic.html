        <h2>Spinosarus</h2>

        <p>Now onto dinosaurs, the spinosaurus is a genus of large spinosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, roughly 99 to 93.5 million years ago. These dinosaurs stand out due to their unique adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, which made them the first known swimming dinosaur. The spinosaurus boasted a large sail, a crocidile-like snout with cone-shaped teeth for catching fish, and paddle-like feet. This creature also had dense bones which aided in underwater maneuverability, and its nostrils were positioned further up its snout, allowing underwater breathe for a short matter of time. Although the spinosaurus would've mainly fed on fish due to its semi-aquatic capabilities, it may have also preyed upon smaller-land-based dinosaurs. This would be led to by its size. The spinosaurus is said to have grown bigger than the famous, Tyrannosaurus Rex, with estimates showing it to have grown 49 to 52 feet, making it one of if not the largest carnivorous dinosaur.</p>
    
        <h2>Pterodactyl</h2>

        <p>Pterodactyls are flying reptiles that lived during the Triassic Period about 220 million years ago. These flying creatures were known as the first flying verdebrates. They were distinguished by their wings supported by a single elongated finger. They also appeared in diverse sizes, ranging from crow-sized to the largest flying animls ever. An example would be the Quetzalcoatlus, which compared in size to a small airplane. They've also been considered to inhabit various environments beyond just coastal areas. Some of these other environments can include areas such as forests. Pterodactyls are widely considered to have been carnivorous creatures, as they fed on certain animals such as fish, insects, and other small animals. Their adaptations for flight included features like air sacs in their bones and strong muscles, enhancing their ability to fly efficiently. As a matter of fact, while pterodactyls are often associated with dinosaurs, like in the Jurassic World movies and other popular media, these creatures are actually a separate group of flying reptiles called pterosaurs.</p>
        
        <h2>Ankylosaurus</h2>
        <img src="https://www.hoo-zoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ankylosaurus-magniventris-1600x909-1-1200x682.jpeg" alt="Ankylosaurus" height="200" width="400">
        <p>The ankylosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, about 68-66 million years ago. This quadrupedal creature is widely renowned for its heavily armored body and distinctive tail club. The combination of its armor and tail club made it a formidable creature, capable of defending itself against even the largest of preadtors. The bony plates that covered its body are called osteoderms, which embedded in its skin. These plates provided significant protection against other creatures such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The tail club on the other hand was used to swing with considerable force, capable of shattering bones and other tough materials such as solid rocks. Despite its formidable defenses, the ankylosaurus is said to have had a herbivorous diet, feeding on low-lying vegetation.</p>
        
        <h2>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h2>

        <p>Now with the most iconic dinosaur species that acts as the face of the topic of dinosaurs. The tyrannosaurus rex, or commonly referred to as the t-rex for short by most people, lived during the Late Cretaceous Period, 72.7 to 66 million years ago. It is widely known for being one of the largest and most ferocious carnivorous dinosaurs that ever lived, aside from the already aggressive spinosaurus. The tyrannosaurus rex is also known for its powerful bite, sharp teeth, and relatively short arms. Some specimens have reached up to 40 feet in length and 13 feet in height at the hips. It was widely considered the top predator of the food chain during its time. The t.rex also possessed a large head, strong legs, and a long, heavy tail that acted as a counterbalance. Although its arms were relatively small compared to the rest of its body, they were still considered strong and had two claws. However, some recent studies have suggested that the t.rex may have had feathers. The t.rex's popularity has been further raised by its frequent appearances in popular media, like in the Jurassic Park franchise, and its prominent place in dinosaur exhibits within museums.</p>
